# vagrant-ansible-experiments

Very rough notes:
* Use Centos 7 base image from https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/7/versions/1804.02
* Clone this repo and cd into it
* Run: `vagrant up`
* Vagrant sets up the basic VM (OS only) and installs Ansible
* Vagrant runs the ansible_local provider with a trivial "Hello World" playbook
* Run: `vagrant ssh`
* Follow instructions at https://github.com/UCLALibrary/ansible_uclalib_plays/tree/master/sandbox/www.library.ucla.edu
